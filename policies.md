This information posted on this webpage is provided as a public service and is generated from submitted information from volunteers. There is no guarantee of accuracy, and no warranty is expressed or implied.

The source of any submitted information to the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Jobs webpage will be kept confidential. The names appearing on short lists and offer lists will come entirely from submissions from volunteers. The only exceptions are names that have appeared already in the public record on other theory jobs pages or publicly announced by the hiring institution. The webpage manager will not make submissions himself nor add names to the lists based upon private discussions not intended for posting. Self-reporting is allowed and encouraged. Information on new job postings and feedback for improving the webpage are welcome at any time.
